## [Unreleased]

---

## [2026-07-04] — Structural cleanup (Phase 5B, part 1)

### Added
- Structured `form` field in the `/chat` response (`"crush" | "contact" | null`) —
  the frontend renders forms from the pipeline's state machines instead of
  pattern-matching answer text

### Changed
- Orchestrator slimmed from 879 to ~300 lines: discovery hooks/pacing extracted to
  `util_discovery_hooks.py`
- Twilio/Resend read their config from the central settings object (one place env
  vars are read)
- CORS: strict origin allow-list when `FRONTEND_URL` is set (was wildcard +
  credentials, a spec-invalid pair), logged permissive fallback otherwise

### Removed
- langgraph dependency: the Studio StateGraph was built at module import
  (constructing network clients on every cold start, for visualization nobody
  used); `chat_history` is now typed as the plain message list it is

---

## [2026-07-04] — Code-level credibility (Phase 5, part 1)

### Added
- Real hallucination check: percentages, dollar amounts, and URLs in generated
  answers are verified against retrieved sources; staged rollout via
  `HALLUCINATION_GATE` (log → enforce), 13 new tests

### Fixed
- False "Resume dispatched" SMS on resume requests (dead resume-email actions
  removed; resume requests now route to the reach-out offer)
- Generation could append a factually wrong tech-stack line to answers
  ("Ensure test expectation" hack removed)
- Architecture snippet shown to visitors was a fabricated 18-node LangGraph
  sketch — now a faithful view of the real 22-node pipeline
- Code index scanned a nonexistent `src/` directory (silently indexing nothing)
- `EMBEDDING_MODEL` setting was unread with the wrong default (ada-002)

### Changed
- All dependency-fallback shims fail loud (ImportError) instead of silently
  substituting fake embeddings, empty loaders, or an echo LLM
- Pipeline docstring now lists the nodes that actually run; invented latency
  figures removed

### Removed
- ~1,300 lines of admitted-dead code: role/visitor-type machinery, menu
  validators, `ChatOpenAI` alias, legacy `OPENAI_*` settings, empty
  `settings.py`, unused monitor module, eight one-off scripts, frontend
  mock-response module

---

## [2026-07-04] — Test suite resurrection (Phase 4)

### Added
- Hermetic tests for the flagship claims: intent routing (classifier faked, incl.
  outage fallback), grounding-validation thresholds, verbatim-copy detection,
  conversation phases, pgvector threshold plumbing
- Rewritten end-to-end pipeline tests against the current partial-dict contract
- Frontend: ESLint (next/core-web-vitals), 19 vitest tests for form detection,
  and its first CI workflow (lint, typecheck, test, build)
- pyproject pytest/coverage config; pinned `requirements-dev.txt`; working
  pre-commit setup

### Changed
- Live-API evals are opt-in (`pytest -m live`) — collection no longer requires keys
- Backend CI runs the full suite with coverage (79 tests; was a 3-file allowlist)

### Removed
- Test modules and scripts that exercised removed architecture (RoleRouter,
  Vercel handlers, visitor-type detection, resume-dispatch actions)

---

## [2026-07-04] — One deployment story (Phase 3)

### Removed
- Dead Vercel/Next.js deployment target: the in-repo Next.js app (a stale copy of the
  deployed frontend), Vercel Python serverless handlers, `vercel.json`, `runtime.txt`,
  `.railwayignore`, and their orphaned scripts/tests
- Dead Streamlit tree (`assistant/main.py`, `assistant/ui/`, `assistant/integration/`)
  and the test files that imported it

### Changed
- Dockerfile no longer copies `.env` into the image; ships `data/` (read by the RAG
  factory at startup); `.dockerignore` added
- Python version declared once: 3.12 (`.python-version`, `pyproject.toml`)
- `api/README.md` rewritten against the actual `POST /chat` contract

---

## [2026-07-04] — Repo professionalization (Phases 1–2)

### Added
- Passing CI workflow (`tests.yml`) running the hermetic test subset on every push
- MIT LICENSE (this repo and portfolia_frontend)
- README and `.env.example` for portfolia_frontend
- `docs/README.md` index

### Changed
- Dashboard auth hardened: fail-closed middleware, HMAC-signed expiring session cookie
  (replaces plaintext-password cookie), constant-time comparisons
- README rewritten against the current system (Claude Sonnet 4.5, pgvector, FastAPI on
  Railway, Next.js frontend on Vercel) with a Mermaid architecture diagram
- `.env.example` regenerated from the variables the code actually reads
  (fixes `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` → `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`)
- CLAUDE.md slimmed to lean agent instructions; persona playbook moved to a local file
- docs/ reduced to four maintained references (glossary, external services, LangSmith,
  observability) — 30+ stale session/planning documents removed

### Fixed
- Crush-confession DB write read the wrong env var name (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`),
  causing silent insert failures when the legacy alias wasn't set
- Broken CI workflows that invoked nonexistent files (red on all 309 runs)
- Tracked build artifacts, backup files, and FAISS-era stubs removed from git

### Removed
- 10 stale remote branches (preserved as `archive/*` tags)
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (documented a nonexistent `src/` layout)

---

## [2026-03] — Claude migration & universal pipeline (consolidated)

### Changed
- Generation moved from OpenAI GPT-4o to Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5; intent
  classification to Claude Haiku
- Role-based conversation branching replaced with a single universal pipeline
  (4 welcome buttons, no per-visitor routing)
- Retrieval consolidated on Supabase pgvector (`match_kb_chunks` RPC, 0.50/0.30
  thresholds); FAISS removed
- Frontend split into its own repo (portfolia_frontend) deployed on Vercel;
  backend deployed as FastAPI on Railway
- Knowledge base rewritten and re-embedded (voice, accuracy, K-Means project added)

### Added
- Crush-confession flow as a single-form state machine with Twilio SMS notification
- Universal contact-capture flow writing to `recruiter_leads`
- Markdown rendering in the frontend (react-markdown + remark-gfm)

project and were removed during the July 2026 documentation cleanup; they remain
