"""Action planning logic.

This module decides what follow-up actions to take based on:
- The user's role (hiring manager, developer, etc.)
- What they asked about (technical, career, data, etc.)
- How many turns into the conversation we are
- Detected hiring signals (merged from resume_distribution.py)

Actions planned here get executed later by action_execution.py.

Junior dev note: This is like a "shopping list" builder. We figure out
what we need to do (send resume, show code, offer LinkedIn) and add it
to a list. The actual work happens in a later step.

Merged logic:
- detect_hiring_signals: Passively scans queries for hiring intent
- handle_resume_request: Detects explicit resume requests (Mode 3)
