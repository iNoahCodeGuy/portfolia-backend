The flagship project is what you're talking to -- a RAG-powered conversational assistant with semantic search and intent classification. He also built predictive models (logistic regression, Naive Bayes), unsupervised clustering studies, and data visualization tools.

            Professionally: Inside Sales Advisor at Tesla, top 10% performer. Before that, logistics operations at TQL and real estate transactions at Signature Real Estate Group. He's also been coaching BJJ and MMA at Xtreme Couture since 2021. The technical foundation comes from a Biology degree at UNLV -- biostatistics and experimental design, not computer science.

            Seven projects. Each one started with a problem worth solving.

            **Portfolia AI Assistant** -- Most portfolio sites are static pages you skim and forget. This is a 22-node RAG pipeline with pgvector semantic search, Claude Sonnet 4.5 for generation, and intent classification before retrieval so greetings don't waste a vector search. You're using it.

            **Employee Attrition -- Logistic Regression** -- HR teams can't predict who's leaving until it's too late. Feature engineering on imbalanced data, cross-validation, ROC analysis. 94.75% accuracy where naive approaches plateau around 83%.

            **Employee Attrition -- Naive Bayes** -- Same dataset, different question. Logistic regression maximizes overall accuracy but misses leavers. Naive Bayes trades that for 10% higher recall on the class that actually costs money -- 58% vs 48%. Five class imbalance variants tested.

            **Customer Segmentation -- Decision Trees** -- A telecom company's customer labels don't explain behavior. Supervised classification found education and tenure drive 81% of segmentation. Region, gender, and age contribute nothing. Interpretable rules over raw accuracy.

            **Customer Segmentation -- K-Means Clustering** -- Same dataset, opposite approach. Forget the labels -- what structure actually exists? Two algorithms independently found four natural segments driven by life-stage and income. The existing labels mapped to none of them.

            **Response Time Analysis** -- No quick way to test whether response time differences are real or noise. A Streamlit app with statistical hypothesis testing and time-series visualization.

            **Lead Response Heatmap** -- Sales teams can't see when leads go unanswered. A reusable Streamlit dashboard using pandas and Plotly to visualize coverage gaps.

            Every pattern behind this conversation maps directly to enterprise AI systems in production. This is a 22-node agentic pipeline running seven processing stages — here is how each one translates.

            **Intent classification and agent routing.** Claude Haiku classifies every inbound message in ~150ms before anything else runs. Greetings, crush confessions, and small talk short-circuit the pipeline entirely — they never hit retrieval or generation. At enterprise scale, this is how customer support agents and voice agents avoid embedding every "hello" into a vector database. The classifier would be a fine-tuned or distilled model for sub-50ms latency at millions of requests, but the architecture decision — classify first, route second — stays identical.

            **RAG with retrieval quality gates.** The vector layer started on FAISS for local prototyping — fast in-memory approximate nearest neighbor search, no external dependency. It migrated to Supabase pgvector for production: managed Postgres with vector search, relational data, and RPC functions in a single service. OpenAI text-embedding-3-small at 1536 dimensions, cosine similarity, dual thresholds (0.50 strict / 0.30 fallback). Grounding validation checks whether retrieved chunks actually support answering the query — not just whether chunks were returned. In enterprise, this is how you prevent a financial services agent from citing an outdated policy or a healthcare agent from fabricating a drug interaction.

            **Continuous model evaluation.** Hallucination checking compares every generated response against retrieved source material. Verbatim copy detection ensures conversational value over regurgitation. LangSmith traces every LLM call with full prompt, response, latency, and cost. These three layers — grounding, faithfulness, originality — run on every single response. Not as a batch evaluation after deployment.

            **Deterministic tool execution.** I write to Supabase, send SMS via Twilio, and fire transactional email via Resend. The pipeline's state machine decides when to execute — not the LLM. That means no hallucinated function calls, no skipped actions, no out-of-order execution. For any system that sends real messages to real people, that reliability is not optional.

            **Stateless agent coordination.** The entire pipeline is serverless-compatible — every request reconstructs state from conversation history. Multi-step workflows (crush confessions, contact capture) use marker-based state machines recovered from the transcript on each turn. No Redis, no server-side sessions, no sticky routing.

            **Knowledge base engineering.** The curated KB is ~200 chunks across 12 domain-specific CSVs. Each chunk is authored for retrieval quality — not scraped or auto-generated. The migration pipeline handles embedding generation, batching, and Supabase insertion. Adding new knowledge is: write Q&A pairs, run the migration script, done.

            Pick any layer and I'll go deeper on how the pattern transfers to enterprise scale — or ask about one of Noah's other projects."""),
